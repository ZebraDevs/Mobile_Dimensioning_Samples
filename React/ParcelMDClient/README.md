This application is designed to demonstrate how to use the react-native-mobile-parcel-dimensioning module to enable mobile dimensioning on Zebra mobile computers.

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use the following command to build and run your Android app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio.
